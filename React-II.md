# React Concepts



## `React.StrictMode`

- `React.StrictMode` is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application.
- Strict mode is a set of development tools that help you catch potential problems in your code before they become actual bugs. When you enable strict mode in your React application, youâ€™re essentially telling React to turn on a bunch of extra checks and warnings that are designed to help you write better code.
- These checks and warnings can catch things like:
  - Components with side effects
  - Deprecated or unsafe lifecycle methods
  - Unsafe use of certain built in functions
  - Duplicate keys in lists
